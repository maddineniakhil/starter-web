LOS ANGELES-- Democrat lawmakers in California are reportedly gaining support for an initative that would provide state residents with $600 extra per week in unemployment benefits in the event that Congress does not renew the benefit.

The Los Angeles Times reported that the state’s assembly—led by Assemblyman Phil Ting, a Democrat and head of the Assembly  Budget  Committee—identified many in the state who rely on the additional funds to pay rent and put food on the table.
